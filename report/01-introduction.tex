Machine learning is a branch of computer science that seeks to use example data and past experience to improve algorithm performance~\cite{alpaydin:2004:introduction}. In this paper machine learning methods are evaluated using the Vinho Verde dataset~\cite{cortez:2009:modeling}. More specifically various machine learning methods are used to perform classification and regression tasks. 

Machine learning is a broad subject of research and its applications have garnered a lot of interest from the industry in recent years. This paper does not seek to provide in-depth analysis of the best possible methods on the given tasks but rather provide an experiment backed overview to couple of popular methods used in modern machine learning. A good overview to the basic machine learning methods and their mathematical grounding is given by Alpaydin in~\cite{alpaydin:2004:introduction}. The Alpaydin book covers most of the methods used in this paper except for neural networks based extreme learning machines. Neural networks are discussed in~\cite{haykin:2009:neural-networks}.

Experiments are conducted in this paper to demonstrate the performance and ease of use of different machine learning algorithms. Many popular machine learning methods require large training datasets and it seems likely that the Vinho Verde dataset has too few samples to be predicted on efficiently with such methods.
