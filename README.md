# Cracking the Vinho Verde Wine Data: Extreme Learning Machines vs. Boosted Decision Trees
In this paper machine learning methods for classification and regression are overviewed. An experimental evaluation of the methods is carried out on the Vinho Verde dataset. The classification methods used are k-nearest-neighbor classifier, bagged decision trees and support vector machines. Multivariate linear regression and extreme learning machines are used for regression. A theoretical overview of the methods is given. Implementations for k-NN classifier, multivariate linear regression and elm are explained. The best performing classification method was the bagged decision trees classifier and the best performing regression method the extreme learning machine.
